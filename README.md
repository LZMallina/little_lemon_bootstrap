# Week 2 (Project Foundations)

## Setting up the HTML document
1) Set up te intial semantic structure
* replace the App component's root element div with react fragment
2) Break the sections down into React components
3) Add the logo and navigation elements
* In order to get the links compatible to github page, you need version 5 of react-dom, which contains the Switch component

To init react-dom version 5:

$npm install react-router-dom@5

To init the most recent react-router-dom automatically:

$npm install react-router-dom

* Open index.js,

import {HashRouter} from 'react-router-dom'

Wrap App/ with HashRouter.  For some reason, github page does not recognize BrowserRouter.

4) Add the footer content
* Add fontawesome dependency
$ npm i --save @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons

$ npm i --save @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core

$ npm i --save @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons

$ npm i --save @fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icons

$ npm i --save @fortawesome/react-fontawesome@latest

* to fix dependency problem during installation:

$ npm i --save @fortawesome/react-fontawesome@latest

## Adding meta tags and setting up OGP (Open Graph Protocol)
* OGP enhance social media search.

1) Add the appropriate description meta tag:

* In public folder, open index.html, inside <head> add <meta name ="description" content ="your text goes here">;

2) Add the og:title meta tag

* <meta name ="og:title" content = "" />

3) Add the og:description meta tag

* <meta name ="og:description" content = " />

3) Code the first version of the hompepage's components

4) Style the homepage components

# Week 3: Table booking system

## Defining the Bookings page

1) Check the components and routes
* create the BookingForm and BookingPage components

* use Formik  to create forms and yup for form verification

$ npm install formik --save

import {useFormik} from "formik";

$ npm install yup react-yup

import *as Yup from 'yup';
* The BookingPage will contain the BookingForm components
* Check that your routes and navigation works
* download react-datepicker

$ npm install react-datepicker --save

2. Code the form structure
* use sessionStorage and localStorage to store inputs

3. Create a local host data base API to store items in the menu so we can use fetch

* create a folder outside of src name: data
* inside of data, create a new file name db.json, which would be a Object storage
* cut and pasted the menu items to the db.json
* ensure all data is in json format.
* open a new terminal window, create a REST API in localHost3500

$ npx json-server -p 3500 -w data/db.json

* No access to API outside of localhost, therefore, hosted API on github instead.  Since github API is raw data, I can only perform fetch not POST or any other http functions.

# Week 4
* Redo app for mobile friendly with react-bootstrap and bootstrap.
